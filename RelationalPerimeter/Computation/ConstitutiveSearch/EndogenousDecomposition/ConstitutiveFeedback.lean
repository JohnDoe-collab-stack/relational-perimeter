# Constitutive feedback into the next discovery

This layer refines the already executed sequential history.  It does not
replace `GeneratedStep` by an operational relation.  Instead, it threads the
assignment returned by the executed code together with the ordered AND
decisions and their provenance.  The next candidate list is produced only
after that transmitted state has been inspected.
