# Constructive non-factorization through information-forgetting projections

The closure program needs a precise notion of information loss.

A property factors through a projection when it can be recovered solely from
the projected value. A value-valued observation factors through a projection
when one function of the projected value reproduces that observation exactly.
A total action factors through a projection when one projected action recovers
its result on every argument.

The generic separator theorems below are constructive:
* equal projections with opposite predicate truth values refute predicate
  factorization;
* equal projections with distinct observed values refute value factorization;
* equal projections with total actions that differ at one argument refute
  action factorization.

The last statement isolates the information-loss principle needed by the
operational-stability layer. The equality of projections is an explicit
hypothesis and is consumed by the proof; it need not be definitional.

/--
A projection collision with different total actions constructively refutes
factorization of that action through the projection.

The middle equality necessarily consumes `collision.sameProjection`; therefore
the theorem applies equally when the projected values are only propositionally
equal and not definitionally identical.
