# Constitutive generation for computation

This module exposes exactly the structural material that the computation reads
from the relational perimeter.  Starting from the canonical perimeter, it
iterates the actual free generator and records the exact old/fresh split of
occurrences at every successor step.

No concrete realization, comparison between representations, acceptance
criterion, search relation, or operational decision occurs in this layer.
